     TODO:
     ( ) Test all PWM signals
     ( ) Test ADC reading
     ( ) Add stator angle calculation function
     ( ) Stress test to see max output speed for both changes in d0 and update frequency
     ( ) From stress test, determine combination function of d0 and update period from analog input
     ( ) Overall testing and debugging
